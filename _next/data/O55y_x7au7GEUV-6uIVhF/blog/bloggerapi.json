This information is meant to be timely, what the authors want to publish to the world now.\r\n\r\nComments: A comment is the place where people other than the blog post author react.\r\n\r\nPages: A page is a place for static content, such as biographical information, or the ways to contact the user.\r\n\r\nUsers: A user is someone who interacts with Blogger, be they acting as an Author, an Administrator, or just a Reader. For public blogs, readers may be anonymous, but on private blogs a reader must be identified by Blogger.\r\n\r\n####Blogger API data model\r\nA resource is an individual data entity with a unique identifier.
